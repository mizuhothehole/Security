All encryptions in 2017

1.des ： symmetric and not safe. broke in 1999. the speed is fast，so used in big data conditions.
2.des3 ：symmetric and safe.  based on des. using three private keys to calculate the data of encryption three times.much safer than des.
3.aes ： symmetric and safe. developed from des. also very fast and is the newest standard of the USA.
4.md5 ： dispersive . safe
5.sha1： dispersive . safe
6.rsa ： not symmetric . safe . having private key and public key.
7.dsa ： not symmetric . safe . 
8.ecc ： not symmetric . safe .

All the encryptions can be done by java or any other programming languages.

After the quantum computer is developed all encryptions above will be having no security
