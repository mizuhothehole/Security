暗号化に対してフィストとラインダール

i read some books about codes and i find two ways of encryption.  
Des this uses a round function and one round will make 50　percent of the plain text became unreadable.des is a kind of function that makes encryption by block of 64Bytes .the Bytes are processes like this ,dividing the 64Bytes into 2parts and then use the right part and key(also 64Bytes ) calculatord by the method you refined.use the result and the left part to make a XOR,then switch the left block and the right block.then make the same processes more one time.
The series of processes is called one round .
At the first round and the end round the switch will not happen . The middle processes will always switch. The round function is defined by who.
