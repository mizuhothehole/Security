暗号化に対してフィストとラインダール

I read some books about codes and i find two ways of encryption.  
Des this uses a round function and one round will make 50　percent of the plain text became unreadable.des is a kind of function that makes encryption by block of 64Bytes .the Bytes are processes like this ,dividing the 64Bytes into 2parts and then use the right part and key(also 64Bytes ) calculatord by the method you refined.use the result and the left part to make a XOR,then switch the left block and the right block.then make the same processes more one time.
The series of processes is called one round .
At the first round and the end round the switch will not happen . The middle processes will always switch. The round function is defined by who.
The codes are encrypted by 64bit blocks. Anyway, it seems 

The other way to encrypt is called aes.
This is also a kind of block encryption. First we make a 128bit block,　the calculation is mainly done in this block. First we must do the first processing,made like this, 4 steps . Firstly calculate the block all,to make the 4*4block all changed.then the second step is to switch one row in the block. The third step is calculating the columns. The last step is do the XOR by a key of aes.
