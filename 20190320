Android application security

Recently I am thinking some kind of issues that has great risks.
To avoid these, here is some good coding practice:

	1.The android:debuggable is a risk of memory hacking.
	To avoid this kind of issues, may try to set this to be false in AndroidManifest.xml

	2.The android:exported should be false essentially, unless you want some other process
	to see your data or open your activity.

	3.The android:usesCleartextTraffic should be set to false, unless you want some http trffic.

	4.The android:launchMode should be considered to be 「normal」.

	5.Avoid using ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK while launching a new activity.

	6.Do not define android:taskAffinity, just use the default.

	7.Android provider has readable/writable control. Try to define them for better security.

	8.In-house applications: use same signature and define customized permissions of "signature" protection.
	And then check whether the caller has the same package name as expected.

	9.Make android:allowBackup false. because it will leak security data.
